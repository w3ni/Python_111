- What is virtual environment ?
    - Python virtual environments help decouple and isolate Python installs and associated pip packages.  This allows end-users to install and manage their own set of packages  that are independent of those provided by the system or used by other  projects.  
- Create new folder and open with terminal then
    - Create a new virtual environment python -m venv myenv 
    - Active environment source myenv/bin/activate  or myenv/Scripts/activate.bat 
    - for deactivate deactivate
